## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned handling background colors and text color of the same color but with different opacities. I reinforced mobile-first workflow
and thanks to that I completed the task quicker.

### Continued development

I want to continue development of more complex layouts and colors with the help of CSS preprocessors.
